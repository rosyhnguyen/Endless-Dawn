                <h3>Terms and conditions</h3>
                <p>
                    These terms and conditions ("Agreement") sets forth the general terms and conditions of your use of
                    the myqclub.ca website ("Website"), "Q Club" mobile application ("Mobile Application") and any of
                    their related products and services (collectively, "Services"). This Agreement is legally binding
                    between you ("User", "you" or "your") and 1246599 BC Ltd. ("1246599 BC Ltd.", "we", "us" or "our").
                    By accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be
                    bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a
                    business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to
                    this Agreement, in which case the terms "User", "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity. If you
                    do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this Agreement, you must not
                    accept this Agreement and may not access and use the Services. You acknowledge that this Agreement
                    is a contract between you and 1246599 BC Ltd., even though it is electronic and is not physically

                <h3>
                    Accounts and membership</h3>
                <p>If you create an account on the Services, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your
                    account and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other
                    actions taken in connection with it. We may monitor and review new accounts before you may sign in
                    and start using the Services. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the
                    termination of your account. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account
                    or any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including
                    any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or
                    delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of
                    this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If
                    we delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may
                    block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.</p>

                    for the purpose of providing the Services to you. Without limiting any of those representations or
                    warranties, we have the right, though not the obligation, to, in our own sole discretion, refuse or
                    remove any Content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any of our policies or is in any way
                    harmful or objectionable. You also grant us the license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish or
                    distribute the Content created by you or stored in your user account for commercial, marketing or

                terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. If, in our judgment, your purchase
                constitutes a high-risk transaction, we will require you to provide us with a copy of your valid
                government-issued photo identification, and possibly a copy of a recent bank statement for the credit or
                debit card used for the purchase. We reserve the right to change products and product pricing at any
                time. We also reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We may, in our sole discretion,
                limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may
                include orders placed by or under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that
                use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a change to or cancel an order,
                we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number provided at
                the time the order was made.</p>
                <h3>Accuracy of information</h3>

                    inaccuracies or omissions that may relate to product descriptions, pricing, availability, promotions
                    and offers. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions, and to change or

                    obligation to update, amend or clarify information on the Services including, without limitation,
                    pricing information, except as required by law. No specified update or refresh date applied on the
                    Services should be taken to indicate that all information on the Services or Services has been
                    modified or updated.</p>
