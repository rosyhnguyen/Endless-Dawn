                <h2>Privacy and Policy</h2>
                <p>This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how the personally identifiable information ("Personal
                    Information") you may
                    provide on the Myqclub.ca website ("Website"), "Q Club" mobile application ("Mobile Application")
                    and any of their
                    related products and services (collectively, "Services") is collected, protected and used. It also
                    describes the choices
                    available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update
                    this information. This
                    Policy is a legally binding agreement between you ("User", "you" or "your") and 1246599 BC Ltd.
                    ("1246599 BC Ltd.",
                    "we", "us" or "our"). By accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read,
                    understood, and agree to
                    be bound by the terms of this Agreement. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies
                    that we do not own or
                    control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
                </p>
                <h3>Automatic collection of information</h3>
                <p>When you open the Website or use the Mobile Application, our servers automatically record information
                    that your browser
                    or device sends. This data may include information such as your device's IP address and location,
                    browser and device
                    name and version, operating system type and version, language preferences, the webpage you were
                    visiting before you came
                    to the Services, pages of the Services that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information
                    you search for on the
                    Services, access times and dates, and other statistics.</p>
                <p>Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish
                    statistical
                    information regarding the usage and traffic of the Services. This statistical information is not
                    otherwise aggregated in
                    such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.</p>
                <h3>Collection of personal information</h3>
                <p>You can access and use the Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by
                    which someone could
                    identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the
                    features on the Services,
                    you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail
                    address). We receive and
                    store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, publish content, or
                    fill any online forms
                    on the Services. When required, this information may include the following:</p>
                <p>- Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.</p>
                <p>- Contact information such as email address, address, etc.</p>
                <p>- Account details such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc.</p>
                <p>- Geolocation data such as latitude and longitude.</p>
                <p>- Certain features on the mobile device such as contacts, calendar, gallery, etc.</p>
                <p>You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take
                    advantage of some
                    of the features on the Services. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are
                    welcome to contact us.</p>
                <h3>Use and processing of collected information</h3>
                <p>In order to make the Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to collect and
                    use certain
                    Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to
                    provide you with the
                    requested products or services. Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the
                    Services. However, we
                    may also collect Personal Information about you from other sources. Any of the information we
                    collect from you may be
                    used for the following purposes:</p>
                <p>- Create and manage user accounts</p>
                <p>- Fulfill and manage orders</p>
                <p>- Respond to inquiries and offer support</p>

                <p>- Request user feedback</p>
                <p>- Improve user experience</p>
                <p>- Post customer testimonials</p>
                <p>- Deliver targeted advertising</p>
                <p>- Administer prize draws and competitions</p>
                <p>- Enforce terms and conditions and policies</p>
                <p>- Protect from abuse and malicious users</p>
                <p>- Respond to legal requests and prevent harm</p>
                <p>- Run and operate the Services</p>
                <p>Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Services, where you are
                    located in the world
                    and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific
                    purposes; this, however,
                    does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to European data
                    protection law; (ii)
                    provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any
                    pre-contractual
                    obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which
                    you are subject; (iv)
                    processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
                    official authority
                    vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us
                    or by a third
                    party.
                </p>
                <p>Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such
                    processing (by
                    opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In
                    any case, we will be
                    happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether
                    the provision of
                    Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter
                    into a contract.</p>
                <h3>Managing information</h3>
                <p>You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you
                    can delete may
                    change as the Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may maintain a copy
                    of the unrevised
                    Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our
                    affiliates and
                    partners, and for the purposes described below. If you would like to delete your Personal
                    Information or permanently
                    delete your account, you can do so on the settings page of your account on the Services.</p>
                <h3>Disclosure of information</h3>
                <p>Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any
                    service you have
                    requested, we may share your information with your consent with our trusted third parties that work
                    with us, any other
                    affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Services available to
                    you. We do not share
                    Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties. These service providers are not authorized to
                    use or disclose your
                    information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.
                    We may share your
                    Personal Information for these purposes only with third parties whose privacy policies are
                    consistent with ours or who
                    agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. These third parties are given
                    Personal Information
                    they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use
                    or disclose Personal
                    Information for their own marketing or other purposes.</p>
                <p>In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger or acquisition by another company,
                    or sale of all or
                    a portion of its assets, your user account, and Personal Information will likely be among the assets
                    transferred.</p>
                <h3>Retention of information</h3>
                <p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal
                    obligations, resolve
                    disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by
                    law. We may use any
                    aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete
                    it, but not in a
                    manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information
                    shall be deleted.
                    Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to
                    data portability
                    cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p>
                <h3>The rights of users</h3>
                <p>You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have
                    the right to do the
                    following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent
                    to the processing of
                    your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your information if the
                    processing is carried
                    out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if information is being
                    processed by us,
                    obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the information
                    undergoing
                    processing; (iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be
                    updated or
                    corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your
                    information, in which
                    case, we will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the
                    right, under certain
                    circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right
                    to receive your
                    information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible,
                    to have it
                    transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable provided that
                    your information is
                    processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which
                    you are part of or on
                    pre-contractual obligations thereof.
                </p>
                <h3>Privacy of children</h3>
                <p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are
                    under the age of 18,
                    please do not submit any Personal Information through the Services. We encourage parents and legal
                    guardians to monitor
                    their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never
                    to provide Personal
                    Information through the Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a
                    child under the age of
                    18 has provided Personal Information to us through the Services, please contact us. You must also be
                    old enough to
                    consent to the processing of your Personal Information in your country (in some countries we may
                    allow your parent or
                    guardian to do so on your behalf).
                </p>
                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                <p>The Services use "cookies" to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that
                    is placed on your
                    hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your
                    computer. Cookies are
                    uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie
                    to you.</p>
                <p> We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for statistical purposes to operate the
                    Services. You have
                    the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you
                    can usually modify
                    your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not
                    be able to fully
                    experience the features of the Services. To learn more about cookies and how to manage them, visit
                    internetcookies.org</p>
                <h3>Do Not Track signals</h3>
                <p>Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not
                    want to have your
                    online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection
                    with a website. For
                    these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who
                    use or visit a
                    website or online service as they move across different websites over time. The Services do not
                    track its visitors over
                    time and across third party websites. However, some third party sites may keep track of your
                    browsing activities when
                    they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.</p>
                <h3>Advertisements</h3>
                <p>We may display online advertisements and we may share aggregated and non-identifying information
                    about our customers
                    that we or our advertisers collect through your use of the Services. We do not share personally
                    identifiable information
                    about individual customers with advertisers. In some instances, we may use this aggregated and
                    non-identifying
                    information to deliver tailored advertisements to the intended audience.</p>
                <h3>Links to other resources
                </h3>
                <p>The Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware
                    that we are not
                    responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We encourage you to
                    be aware when you
                    leave the Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect
                    Personal Information.</p>
                <h3>Information security</h3>
                <p>We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected
                    from unauthorized
                    access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
                    safeguards in an effort to
                    protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in
                    its control and
                    custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed.
                    Therefore, while we
                    strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy
                    limitations of the
                    Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all
                    information and data
                    exchanged between you and the Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data
                    may be viewed or
                    tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.</p>
                <h3>Data breach</h3>
